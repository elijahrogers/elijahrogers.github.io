        <p>
          A tool to help you slow down the infinite scroll of Twitter and Reddit.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many people try to limit their screen time and I'm sure I'm not the only one who found the existing tools lacking. Mostly, they consist of locking yourself out of accessing some websites after a certain amount of use or during certain hours of the day. The problem with these is that - as long as you have the unlock code - you still need to have the willpower to avoid turning them off.
        </p>

        <p>
          Going cold turkey is also a viable option but most people don't want to stop using Twitter or Reddit entirely. Moderation is key. This led me down the path of making the content itself less interesting; to break down the carefully crafted feedback loop that leads to endless scrolling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sleeping Policeman is my attempt to create a gentile nudge to lower screen time. It slowly adds a delay to each request over the course of the day until content takes long enough to load that you find something better to do.

      <div>
        <p>
          A tool to turn photos into a organized collection of highlighted snippets that you can easily search and reference.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project was something I created for my own personal use. I primarily read non-fiction and have a habit of highlighting certain snippets that stand out to me for later reference. Unfortunately, I rarely revisited these ideas since these snippets were not easy to find across an entire bookshelf.
        </p>

        <p>
          Surprisingly, I couldn't find any existing tools to solve this problem. Copying everything into notes or a Word document might work, but it doesn't preserve the original context. If I wanted something like this I'd have to build it myself - so that's exactly what I did!
