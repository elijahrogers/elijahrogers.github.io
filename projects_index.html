          A tool to turn photos into a organized collection of highlighted snippets that you can easily search and reference.

          This project was something I created for my own personal use. I primarily read non-fiction and have a habit of highlighting certain snippets that stand out to me for later reference. Unfortunately, I rarely revisited these ideas since these snippets were not easy to find across an entire bookshelf.

          Surprisingly, I couldn't find any existing tools to solve this problem. Copying everything into notes or a Word document might work, but it doesn't preserve the original context. If I wanted something like this I'd have to build it myself - so that's exactly what I did!
